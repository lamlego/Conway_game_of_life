CONWAY GAME OF LIFE PSUDOCODE:

Create a matrix 
--user input for nxm? user input for how many 'live' cells are at the start?
Fill the matrix with 1s or 0s. [1 = live cell, 0 = no cell]


find a way to display the matrix
--do we just want 1s and 0s to show or should we put more effort into it?


--continiously loop through the matrix 

for (int i = 0; i < m -1; i++)
{
    for (int j = 0; j < n-1; j++)
    {
    --count the number of 'live' cells next to current cell
    #lc<2 & cell = 1
        cell = dead
    #lc>3 & cell = 1
        cell = dead
    #lc = 3 & current cell is 0 
        cell = live
    else cell stays the same
    }
